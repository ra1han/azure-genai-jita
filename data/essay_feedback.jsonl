{"id": "1", "essay_topic":"Fighting climate change", "essay": "Fighting climate change is very important for our planet. The earth is getting hotter and this is causing big problems like wildfires and floods. People should stop cutting too many trees because trees help clean the air. Also, factories and cars make too much smoke, so we need to use less petrol and more electric cars. Recycling is also good because it stops rubbish going in the ocean. Everyone should do small things like turn off lights when not using. If we don't act fast, the world will be in danger and many animals lose their homes. We all must work together to save Earth!", "feedback":"Grammar & Spelling - The grammar is mostly correct, but there are a few small errors in sentence structure.

{"id": "2", "essay_topic":"Amazon rainforest", "essay": "The Amazon rainforest is the biggest rainforest in the world. It has so many animals like jaguars, monkeys and colorful birds. Rain falls a lot here, thats why its called a rainforest. People are cutting down too many trees, and its very bad for nature. The trees make oxygen so we can breath. There are also many rivers in the Amazon, the biggest one is the Amazon River. Some tribes live in the rainforest for many years and they no how to use plants for medicine. If we dont protect the Amazon, lots of animals and plants will disapear forever.", "feedback":"Grammar & Spelling - There are some spelling mistakes like 'thats' (should be 'that's'), 'its' (should be 'it's'), 'breath' (should be 'breathe'), 'no' (should be 'know'), and 'disapear' (should be 'disappear'). Also, 'Rain falls a lot here, thats why its called a rainforest.' could be improved for clarity. Clarity & Fluency - The ideas are clear, but some sentences feel a little short and choppy. For example, 'People are cutting down too many trees, and its very bad for nature.' could be 'People are cutting down too many trees, which is very bad for nature.' Content & Relevance - The essay gives good information about the Amazon rainforest, including its animals, rivers, and people. However, adding more details about why the rainforest is important or how people can help protect it would make it even better. Structure & Organization - The essay does not follow a clear introduction, body, and conclusion, which makes it feel a little unstructured. The ideas jump from one to another quickly. For example, the sentence about rivers comes in between deforestation and tribes, which feels a bit random. A better flow would help. Overall Feedback: The essay has great facts and interesting points about the Amazon rainforest. To improve, try organizing ideas more clearly and fixing small grammar mistakes. Adding more details would also make it even stronger. Keep up the good work!"}
