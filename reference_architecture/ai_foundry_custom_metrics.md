# Execution Plan

## User Goal

Develop an action plan that does the following:                    - Creates two new custom metrics compatible with the Azure AI Evaluation SDK. One metric uses calculates the length of the input. The other metric uses LLM as judge to detect any obscenity in the input.                    - Registers the two custom metrics in Azure AI Foundry.                    - Runs a cloud evaluation using the two metrics which uses an existing dataset in Azure AI Foundry.                    

## Generated Plan

### Step 1: custom_evaluator
