# Execution Plan

## User Goal

Develop a plan of actions that does the following things - develops two new custom metrics which can be used with azure ai evalution sdk and then register those to AI foundry and run a cloud evalution. Finally make a CI pipeline which triggers every time there is a pull request against the main branch. The pipeline should run the evaluation using the two custom evaluators.
